# BetterSimplify

This repository contains source code to interact with [Simplify](http://mmth.us/simplify) OS X application from a
supported web browser.

This is a fork of the [official Simplify browser extension](https://github.com/mmth/simplify_web_suite_core), but is
updated more often, and has a refined set of supported players.

### Directory structure

The repository contains files that are necessary to build extensions for Google Chrome

* `build/` contains the resulting directories with the production-ready extensions. You may not directly modify files in
  this directory, but instead you modify source files and use `gulp` to rebuild extensions again.
* `players/` contains sources for all the players that can be used by Simplify Web Suite Core. They will be
  automatically copied to the extension directories.
* `skeleton/` contains files and templates that are necessary to automatically create extensions. Files that have
  `template.` part in it are interpreted as `EJS` templates and processed accordingly. All other files are copied to the
  appropriate extension directory.
* `config.js` contains version configuration for every browses and directories names.
* `simplify.js` contains the core Simplify object that is used to be used on web-players pages.
* `gulpfile.js` contains the build system which automatically assembles all extensions.

### How to build

In order to build extensions, clone this repository and run `npm install` (make sure you have
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed).

When you installed all the necessary packages using the `npm install` command, you are ready to build extensions. Use
the `npm run gulp` command which will build extensions to the `build/` directory. Every time you run `npm run gulp`, it
will process source files (all files in `players/`, `simplify.js` and all files in `skeleton/`) and override files in
the `build/` directory. Make sure you are not editing any files in the `build/` directory, because they will be
overriden. Edit source files instead.

### Adding players

Create a new `.js` file in the `players/` directory with a header which contains a `@hostname` variable. All files in
the `players/` directory must start with a single-line JavaScript comment `//`.

If you want to create a file to support a player located at `http://theawesomeplayer.com/`, the header must contain the
following value:

```
// My awesome player
// @hostname = theawesomeplayer.com
```

The `@hostname` variable is mandatory and must not be omitted. It may have several domains separated by a white-space:

```
// @hostname = helloworld.com helloworld.net helloworld.org
```

The header may or may not have any other content, but all the first lines in a file must start with `//`. Please see
existing player implementations as an example.

After you added your player or changed its code, run `npm run gulp` to rebuild extensions.

### Build commands

* ```npm run gulp``` builds or rebuils all extension files.
* ```npm run gulp clean``` cleans the `build/` directory completely.
* ```npm run gulp watch``` rebuilds all extensions automatically every time you change source files (all files in
  `players/`, `simplify.js` and all files in `skeleton/`).

## Core API

The core class is a set of methods and properties to interact with the desktop application (server). It implements a
basic client-server protocol on top of the WebSockets connection. The connection itself is created and maintained by the
`Simplify` class. It also automatically reconnects if the connection to server fails.

Core API provides you with two types of methods. You can send various messages to the server to notify it about some
important event on the client side. On the other hand, the server can also send various messages to the client, so Core
API allows you to subscribe to incoming events to handle them appropriately.

Note that you are not supposed to cache any data, like player names, track information, or artwork links. All cache is
stored inside the core class. If the WebSockets connection to the server eventually fails, the client will restore
everything when the connection becomes available.

### Initialization

You can set up a client by instantiating `Simplify`:

```var simplify = new Simplify();```

### setCurrentPlayer(name)

Sends the current player name to the server. Call this method after you've created your own instance of `Simplify`.
Supply a player name as a string. Avoid long names.

### closeCurrentPlayer

Tells the server that the current client is not active anymore. Usually you call this method when page unloads, like:

```
var simplify = new Simplify();

//Handling incoming/outcoming events here

window.addEventListener("unload", function()
{
	simplify.closeCurrentPlayer();
});
```

### setNewPlaybackState(state)

Notifies the server that the playback state should be changed. A `state` variable must be one of the predefined constants:

```
Simplify.PLAYBACK_STATE_PLAYING
Simplify.PLAYBACK_STATE_PAUSED
Simplify.PLAYBACK_STATE_STOPPED
```

You can also use one of the predefined methods to change the playback state: `setPlaybackPaused`, `setPlaybackPlaying`
and `setPlaybackStopped`.

### setCurrentTrack(track)

Sends the information about the current track to the server. This method should be called when a track change occurs.
This method must not be called on a playback state change.

`track` is a dictionary of values. You fill it with all known information about the current track:

```
{
	"author" : track_author,		//Mandatory key
	"title"  : track_title, 		//Mandatory key
	"album"  : track_album,			//Can be omitted
	"length" : track_length,		//Mandatory key
	"uri"		: track_absolute_uri	//Can be omitted
}
```

Sometimes you also may need to tell the server that the current player doesn't support some features, like seeking
tracks or selecting previous track. You can send this useful information by appending `features` key to the
aforementioned dictionary:

```
{
   "author" : track_author,
   "title"  : track_title,
   "album"  : track_album,
   "length" : track_length,
   "features" : {
   	"disable_track_seeking" : true, 		//Disables seeking of current track
   	"disable_previous_track" : true,		//Disables selection of previous track
   	"disable_next_track" : true 			//Disables selection of next track
	}
}
```

You do not need to cache any information about the track. The core class caches everything if necessary.

### setCurrentArtwork(uri)

Notifies the server about a new artwork for the current track. You should supply either an absolute URI to some artwork
or `null` as an `uri` argument. If it is `null`, server will try to find an artwork for this track by itself.

### bindToVolumeRequest(callback)

The server may occassionaly request the current player's volume. It must be returned as an integer (min. 0 and max. 100)
from your `callback` method:

```
simplify.bindToVolumeRequest(function()
{
	//Extract volume and return its amount as an integer
})
```

### bindToTrackPositionRequest(callback)

The server may occassionaly request the current player's track position. It must be returned as an integer representing
the current track position in seconds from `callback`:

```
simplify.bindToTrackPositionRequest(function()
{
	//Extract track position and return its amount in seconds
})
```

### bind(name, callback)

Adds new handler to the specified event. The first argument `name` is one of the predefined names of messages. The
second argument `callback` is a function that will be called when an event arrives.

All events are sent by the server as a reaction to any user actions in the desktop application. For example, when user
modifies volume inside Simplify.app, server sends `Simplify.MESSAGE_DID_CHANGE_VOLUME` to us, and we need to handle it
appropriately.

You are able to call the function like this:

```
simplify.bind(Simplify.MESSAGE_DID_SELECT_PREVIOUS_TRACK, function()
{
	//Select previous track
}).bind(Simplify.MESSAGE_DID_SELECT_NEXT_TRACK, function()
{
	//Select next track
});
```

All message types are described below.

#### Simplify.MESSAGE_DID_SELECT_PREVIOUS_TRACK

Previous track should be selected.

#### Simplify.MESSAGE_DID_SELECT_NEXT_TRACK

Next track should be selected.

#### Simplify.MESSAGE_DID_CHANGE_PLAYBACK_STATE

Playback state should be changed. The server pushes `data["state"]` with a desired state:

```
Simplify.PLAYBACK_STATE_PLAYING
Simplify.PLAYBACK_STATE_PAUSED
Simplify.PLAYBACK_STATE_STOPPED
```

Example of usage:

```
simplify.bind(Simplify.MESSAGE_DID_CHANGE_PLAYBACK_STATE, function(data)
{
	if (data["state"] == Simplify.PLAYBACK_STATE_PLAYING) { /* Play current song */ };
	if (data["state"] == Simplify.PLAYBACK_STATE_PAUSED) { /* Pause current song */ };
});
```

#### Simplify.MESSAGE_DID_CHANGE_VOLUME

Current volume of the player should be changed. Use `data["amount"]` to retrieve new volume, which will be in an
interval between 0 and 100.

Example of usage:

```
simplify.bind(Simplify.MESSAGE_DID_CHANGE_VOLUME, function(data)
{
	//Change volume to data["amount"]
});
```

#### Simplify.MESSAGE_DID_CHANGE_TRACK_POSITION

Current track position should be modified. Use `data["amount"]` to retrieve new position in seconds.

Example of usage:

```
simplify.bind(Simplify.MESSAGE_DID_CHANGE_TRACK_POSITION, function(data)
{
	//Seek track to data["amount"] seconds
});
```

#### Simplify.MESSAGE_DID_SERVER_SHUTDOWN

A service message to notify the client that the server was shut down by a user (Simplify.app was closed). You may want
to subscribe to this event to release resources or clear timeouts and/or intervals.

## Usage tips

Subscribe to the DOM `loaded` event and create an instance of the `Simplify` class. The first and primary thing to do is
to notify the server about the current player by using the `setCurrentPlayer` method. It should be called before any
other methods. Set up all event listeners to handle incoming events and implement sending track information when a track
changes in the web player.

A basic skeleton for handling players:

```
window.addEventListener("load", function()
{
	var simplify = new Simplify();

	simplify.setCurrentPlayer("My Favourite Player");

	//Handle incoming events and send track information here

	window.addEventListener("unload", function()
	{
		simplify.closeCurrentPlayer();
	});
});
```
